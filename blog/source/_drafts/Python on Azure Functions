## Building Python Wheels on Windows 10

My development workstation is running Windows 10 and I wanted to see if I could do all this from here. After all, it's much closer to the runtime environment than it would be from running a VM with, say, Ubuntu.


## Installing Tooling
Python 3.3
Unfortunately if you've taken a lighter-weight approach to running Visual Studio, you won't have the tooling needed to build wheels.

Visual Studio 2015 for Visual C++ 14.0.

Run `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`



Checklist:
 - Python installed
 - VS 2015 installed with C++ features
 - Install `pip`
 - Install `wheels`
