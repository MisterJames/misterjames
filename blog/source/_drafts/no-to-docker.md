Thanks, But No Thanks, Docker


## Migration Is the On-Ramp, Not the Destination
"Lift and shift" is just an entry point to the wider cloud offerings. There is a lot more potent stuff out there, and starting to use virutalization of some sort is likely just the beginning of your migration to cloud. You can't expect to have succeeded in moving to the cloud if all you're doing is running your software on virtual machines. VMs can be a great way to get started, but they _by no means_ reflect a mature implementation of cloud architecture.

So, where do you go beyond that?  I believe that the answer is in the Platform as a Service offering, be it on AWS or Google's cloud or Azure. PaaS architecture allows organizations to focus on the solution rather than the infrastructure. It's not that it doesn't matter - the greatest painters knew what materials they were painting on and understood their qualitites - but infrastructure can fade into the background today much like the selection of a painter's canvas. 

## You Can Have Your Cows, I'm Not Building a Farm
There's a phrase that's becoming popular right now that goes something like, "Your servers shouldn't be pets with personality, they should be treated like cattle."  Well, I say this, "You can keep your cows." And I like a good burger.

But, listen, as far as servers go, yes, I 100% back the effort to remove the unique snowflake that is oh-so-very special in your organization. A named server is a liability for too many reasons and you should work to expunge them from your network if you aren't in a position to leverage PaaS.

But rather than thinking about infrastructure as code, we should be thinking more abstractly in our patterns and approaches. The tools are here, we need to start leveraging them.  From this day forward, I hope to never have to start a project where my regular duties might include installing IIS or scheduling operating system updates.
