Knowing your users is the best way to understand how you can start to piece together your bot, but you don't have to have all the answers right away.

## Channels for Your Bot

A channel is...

## Chosing a Channel
In conversation with other bot writers over the last little while the conversation keeps coming up around how they chose the channels they use in their bot. There is no magic recipe for which channels to use for your organization, but in my case the primary channels will be SMS and Facebook and later via our web site.  For you, the choice will likely come down to the way your users already behave. For one colleague, this meant using Skype as an internal knowledge bot. For another, it was a combination of SMS and web. 

Here's why we chose to move ahead with our selection of SMS and Facebook:

 - Our bot users are mostly customers. When they place orders we proactively start conversations with them. With the conversation primed and started on our end, we can know with greater certainty how to guide the user into the pit of bot success.
 - Some of our users initiate conversations with us by texting our company phone number. By using the SMS channel we can do a "soft" identification with the channel data, resolve the customer and give them information about upcoming orders.
 - Most of our communication is done with customers on Facebook. Approximately 80% of inquiries are about product information and store hours and location. As our Social Media presence grows having a bot to handle this 80% is an effective way to keep our labor costs down for questions like, "When will you have Schmoo Tortes again?" or "Do I have a pie ordered for next Thursday?" or even, "When will you be selling that bread you have with roasted potatoes and caramelized onions?"
