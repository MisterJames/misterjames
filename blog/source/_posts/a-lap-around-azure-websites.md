I am thrilled to be joining the two excellent presenters – [Jon Galloway](https://twitter.com/jongalloway) and [Cory Fowler](https://twitter.com/cfowlerMSFT) – on Microsoft Virtual Academy as a Community Expert to help answer questions through the day. You’ll find me in the chat room, directing you to resources, answering questions and, heck, I might even craft up a sample or two along the way. :)

**_UPDATE_**: I have posted all the links and questions/answers that came up through the session, be sure to check out the [full list here](http://bit.ly/AzureLapQuestions).

## Some Background and Some Present Day

It wasn’t too long ago that Azure Websites was an obscure beast in the cloud mix, with awkward deployment requirements, limited language and platform options and plenty of alternatives that required far less effort with better scaling options.

Today’s Azure Websites’ in equally suitable for greenfield development start-ups, enterprise migrations and hobby sites. A myriad of languages, web stacks, versatility in DB connections, a great deployment story and full integration with the world’s best IDE makes Websites a legitimate consideration for your next – or first – project.
