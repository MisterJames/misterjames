Itâ€™s amazing how great a conversation can be had at a conference.&nbsp; The conversation flows through topics, traversing different folks from different walks and never really ends until you check out of the hotel to return home.&nbsp; Prairie Dev Con 2011 was full of rich conversation with interesting people, enthusiastic about technology and excited about a brief window where they could share cool information about the tools and tech they work with on a regular basis.

Thanks especially to everyone who came out to my sessions; as you start to work with MVC or NuGet I would love to hear how you make out and the kinds of things you do with your projects. And if you have any questions, please feel free to drop me a line via Twitter, here on my blog or via email.

See you all next year at PrDC12!
