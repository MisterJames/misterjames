Another great session today with some good questions and some great conversation afterwards.&nbsp; Thanks peeps!

Here’s some great resources to get you plugged in with NuGet and to help take those first few steps:

*   [http://www.nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org) – the official package source  <li>[http://docs.nuget.org](http://docs.nuget.org) – the basics of working with NuGet and creating your own packages  <li>[http://nuget.codeplex.org](http://nuget.codeplex.org) – the open source code for the NuGet project, as well as key downloads (NuGet.exe and the Package Explorer) 

&nbsp;

You can also follow the NuGet conversation on Twitter (#NuGet), or join in the [StackOverflow.com chat room](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/867/nuget) on the subject.

And as always, feel free to send me a note with any questions you may have.
