This is an installment in a 30 day series on Bootstrap and the MVC Framework. To see more, check out [Day 0 for an index](http://jameschambers.com/2014/06/day-0-boothstrapping-mvc-for-the-next-30-days/).

I hope you’re enjoying the series so far, I’m certainly enjoying creating it. And you know what, blogs are great, but watching live speakers and getting to interact with experts is likely the next-best-thing to in-class training.
