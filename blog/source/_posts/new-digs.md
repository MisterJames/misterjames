I have been on the Blogger platform for years, but have decided to move over to Orchard so that I can further integrate code samples, pick and choose modules and widgets appropriate to my style and take advantage of (and hopefully contribute to) the already mature community around the Orchard engine.

I’m going to ride the default theme for a while as I get my bearings, and I don’t think I’m going to make much effort to port my old posts over to this site.

If you’re looking for the old Mister James site, you can find it at [http://theycallmemrjames.blogspot.com](http://theycallmemrjames.blogspot.com).

Thanks for joining me!
