![image](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/On-Location-Building-Connected-Applicati_E956/image_3.png "image")Hey everyone, I'm geeked out to be joining Jonathan Rozenblit live at the Microsoft office in Mississauga to talk about Windows Azure Mobile Services.

# Set time aside on October 22 at 1pm Eastern!

The theme: connected applications.&nbsp; Mobile devices are limited by computing power.&nbsp; Users want simple authentication (even those that don't understand that appreciate a simple Facebook login to your app).&nbsp; You need power on the service side.&nbsp; You need to support multiple platforms easily.

And perhaps you're building a new client onWindows 8, Windows Phone, iOS or even Android.&nbsp; Regardless of the mobile platform, we're going to equip you with the tools you need to get started building your apps.

For all the details, check out the [information site](http://aka.ms/azurevirtualworkshops) and scroll down to register for the October 22 event.&nbsp; See you all there!
