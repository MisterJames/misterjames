Work has been overly busy lately, almost draining, as I’m in high season for maintenance.&nbsp; With very little new work, it’s long been my challenge to keep motivated when switching from “hunter” to “farmer” mode.

Personally, we’ve had a rough streak as a family, too, having to endure now 12 funerals in the last nine months. This is one of the realities you have to face when you and your spouse have a close family, counting a combined (whopping) total of over 100 blood relatives, nearly all of which are older than you.&nbsp; It’s been a sad couple of seasons at home.

## Sweat to the Rescue

I have always found that getting my heart going helps to clear my mind.&nbsp; I grew up being fairly active playing varsity high school sports and spent six years as a competitive swimmer.&nbsp; I have cycled from Montreal to Banff on a national relay team benefitting Juvenile Diabetes and have put in over 7,000kms on the bike in the last three years.&nbsp; But none in this calendar year.

I have always found that getting a bit of time to work the muscles and think through problems can help me make great strides.&nbsp; In fact, I would argue that some of my best coding – or at least, solving some of my hardest programming challenges – has been away from the keyboard. 

## 100kms and Counting

I’m no longer an ideal candidate for the swim team, nor did I fully grow to a size that any self-respecting volleyball team would give me anything other than bench time, but I do still have my road bike.&nbsp; Technically, I still have my speedos too, but I’m not getting into those anytime soon! ![Winking smile](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Back-on-the-Bike_E4F5/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png)

So my wife and I have reciprocally committed to exercise time and appropriate support for each other.&nbsp; After supper, she heads out for a good brisk walk while the kids and I clean up supper.&nbsp; When the kids head off to bed and she’s putting the baby down I’ve been jumping on my bike.&nbsp; 

In the last 4 days I’ve been increasing my kms and decreasing my time.&nbsp; Last night I posted just over 26kms in a cool 54 minutes riding through the city, an average speed of about 29km/hr (18mph).

Today at work I started with more energy, cleaned off some outstanding maintenance issues and was rewarded by getting to spike out a new project out in WCF and WP7.

It’s amazing what a little exercise can do for you.
