My wife and I are undertaking an enormous shift in our lives and entering the food service industry. My day job will continue to be consulting in the Azure, Cognitive Services and ASP.NET Core space, but I am also privileged to work side-by-side with my incredible wife as we build a bakery together.

My role in the bakery is largely on the technology side, and I'm building everything to do with our "bakery platform" on Azure and related technologies. My wife, of course, is the digital to analog converter. :)

This blog series will cover all the tech that I use and build on. In this post, I'm going 
to layout the feature set for everything that I'll be building along the way and what 
technologies I intend (and actually) use to implement them.

Over the next several months, new blog entries based on the code that helps to build out the following features will be linked below. I hope you enjoy these entries as we build our cloud-based bakery, and that they help you in your coding efforts.

The code for much of the bakery will be freely available on GitHub, though some aspects of the code will be kept private to guard the logic that helps to set us apart. When I have the codebase ready, I'll update this post to get the code out there!

Happy Coding!
