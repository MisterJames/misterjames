## Source Code and Book Now Available

I had many requests through my recent series on [Bootstrapping MVC](http://jameschambers.com/2014/06/day-0-boothstrapping-mvc-for-the-next-30-days/) to post the completed source code for the project that I created, and I’m happy to share that now. 
 > [View the Completed Project on GitHub](https://github.com/MisterJames/BootstrappingMvc-Code) 

I will note that this is how the project is _at the end of the series_ and things do change. Some of the days later on in the exercises are refactorings over the earlier work.

## Getting All the Code, Day-by-Day + Bonuses

I took things further, however, and I’ve edited the series into both an eBook and a print version. Included with either is access to the repository with complete day-by-day branches so that you can work on any aspect of the project, play around, make changes or customizations and then just move to a different chapter.

Can’t get past a certain issue with your syntax or markup? Do a diff against my work and see what got away. Each chapter branch contains the completed, working code for that chapter. You can use the previous chapter’s branch to start work as you follow along from anywhere in the book.

As well, for any of my blog readers (yes, that’s you!) I’m also offering the book at a deeply discounted price of $6.99 (from a suggested $24.99) for the first 50 folks who snatch up the offer!

For those of us (me included) who still like killing trees and having a paper copy next to the keyboard, I’ve also got a print version available of the book which would make a great addition to any web developer’s library.
