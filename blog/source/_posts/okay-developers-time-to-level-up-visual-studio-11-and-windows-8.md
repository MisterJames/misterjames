The bits are now in the wild.&nbsp; I've got Win8 on the download and VS11 installed already on my Win7 boot.&nbsp; I'll be wiping the Win8 partition and installing the Customer Preview of Win8 later today.

# Bringing The Awesome

I'll getting pumped for PrDC Calgary and I'm looking forward to rebuilding my MVC and NuGet talks on Windows 8 and Visual Studio 2011 for that conference. Only a couple weeks to go!&nbsp; Remember, if you're hoping to come to the Dojo session for MVC, please bring along your laptop.&nbsp; I'll be demoing some of the MVC4 bits, so please update your machines before you come (I'll have a few USB keys with the install if you don't have, but please make sure you have VS installed...even the free version).

# Getting Up To Speed

Go grab all the bits for yourself:
