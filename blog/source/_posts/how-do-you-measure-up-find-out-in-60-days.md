I am super geeked to be heading down to Austin, TX to speak at [Measure Up](http://measureup.io/) this coming September 26th. Measure Up 2015 is the inaugural skills and career development conference put on by the folks at [Clear Measure](http://clear-measure.com/).

This conference is packed with all kinds of great speakers and covers a variety of topics related to business development, dev ops, personal growth and, of course, how to be mind-bendingly awesome at making software. I am going to be talking about the things you need to know when [you’re moving to MVC 6](http://measureup2015.azurewebsites.net/mvc6/), and sharing about my experiences as [a remote worker](http://measureup2015.azurewebsites.net/success-as-a-remote-worker/).

## If You Live in the Austin Area…

…you have no excuses to miss this event. Register _<u>today</u>_, [it’s only $10](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/measureup-2015-tickets-16666653409?ref=ecount), and dedicate one day this year to getting yourself closer to your dream career.

## If You Don’t Live in the Austin Area…

…you should probably talk to your boss about getting down there for the day. It’s hard to find a conference with this kind of content and (essentially) only have to pay for a bit of travel, perhaps a hotel room. Professional development does not come with this value for this little.

## So, What Are You Waiting For?

**Check out the conference agenda**. Dev ops, docker. vNext, continuous deployment, load testing, microsevices, infrastructure as code [and more](http://measureup2015.azurewebsites.net/speakers/). 

**Register for the event**. Seriously, [ten bucks](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/measureup-2015-tickets-16666653409?ref=ecount)_. _

See you in September! ‘Til then, happy coding! ![Smile](http://jameschambers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlEmoticon-smile6.png)
