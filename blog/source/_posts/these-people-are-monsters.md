I have had the privledge and pleasure of working with my good friends [Simon Timms](https://twitter.com/stimms) and [Dave Paquette](https://twitter.com/Dave_Paquette) on our new video series, The Monsters Weekly. Recently we have been added as [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/AspNetMonsters) regulars on MSDN and we've been putting together two videos a week for the ASP.NET community.

## What We've Been Working On

It's really gone by quite quickly, I can't believe how fast ten episodes came and went. We have been working on building up content that can be digested in 15 minutes or less. It's easy to get through a video on a short break or over your lunch, so there's no better time to get familiar with the next version of ASP.NET.

Here's a short summary of the first videos we put together on our channel.

### ASP.NET Core - Generally Speaking

 - [A Walkthrough of Startup.cs](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-1-Startupcs)
 - [A Walkthrough of the Default MVC Project](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-8-Tour-of-the-Default-ASPNET-MVC-Project)
 - [Looking at Changes to Controllers in MVC Core](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-9-What-Makes-a-Controller)

### Configuration
 - [A Look at the ASP.NET Core Configuration System](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-5-Configuration-Settings)
 - [Using the Options Pattern to Load Configuration Settings](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-6-JSON-Data-and-The-Options-Pattern)
 - [Storeing your Configuration in a Database in ASP.NET Core](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-10-Loading-Settings-From-a-Database-in-ASPNET-Core)

### Front- and Back-end Updates
 - [Creating Custom Tag Helpers](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-7-Custom-Tag-Helpers)
 - [Serving Static Files in ASP.NET Core](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-2-Static-Files)
 - [A Breakdown of the Default Gulp File in the Project Template](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-3-Default-Gulp-File)
 - [Using Tag Helpers to Help Construct Views in MVC Core and the Razor View Engine](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-4-Tag-Helpers-in-Razor)

As you can see, we're trying to flesh out all areas to cover all aspects of software development. In the weeks ahead we're going to be breaking into Docker, the `dotnet` CLI, changes coming in RC2 and more.

## Some Shameless Self-Promotion

We're also curating a [blog](http://aspnetmonsters.com) with posts from all three of us, news from the Monsters Weekly and other bits. We're tweeting out on the Twitters, too, so please give us a follow/retweet if you don't mind!
