There’s an old joke in software development that has Jesus and Satan in a coding contest. When the power goes out Satan loses all his code and asks for more time, but God denies his request as his opponent was already done. “Sorry,” says God, “but Jesus saves!”.

I lost over an hour’s work tonight on a couple of posts I’m working on. Thankfully, Writer has my back. I don’t know who that makes me in the coding contest, but check out this recovery folder:

C:\Users\_user_name_\AppData\Local\Windows Live Writer\AutoRecover

If Windows Live Writer crashes you can recover most of your work, even if you don’t have autosave enabled. This has got me out of the woods a couple of times.

Happy blogging. ![Smile](https://jcblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/img/2014/06/wlEmoticon-smile1.png)
