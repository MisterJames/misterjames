There is a great conference coming up that is open to everyone with a keyboard and a monitor. This is a **free** event that Microsoft and my fellow MVPs are putting on, May 14th &amp; 15th.&nbsp; Friends, presenters and fellow Microsoft MVPs from the Americas’ region will be live-streaming for two days to share their knowledge and real-world expertise during a free event, the **[MVP Virtual Conference](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualconference.aspx)**. 

The MVP Virtual Conference will showcase 95 sessions of content for IT Pros, Developers and Consumer experts designed to help you navigate life in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President of Developer Platform, [Steve Guggenheimer](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stevengu/archive/2015/04/02/announcing-the-mvp-virtual-conference.aspx), will be on hand to deliver the opening Key Note Address. 

Hey…if you want to play along during the conference, be sure to get yourself a copy of [Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575136) or an IDE of your choice, and sign up for your [free Azure trial](http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200575119).

I was part of the group that had the privilege of picking the sessions. I have to be honest, it wasn’t easy…there were about a billion great topics from the MVPs put forth, and right from the start it was hard to omit any single entry.

The are going to be 5 tracks in the conference, so there is something for everyone who works in IT, regardless of platform:

*   IT Pro English  <li>Dev English  <li>Consumer English  <li>Portuguese mixed sessions  <li>Spanish mixed sessions 

There are some excellent, industry-leading names on the list. Learn from the best and brightest MVPs in the tech world today and develop some great skills.
