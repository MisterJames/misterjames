Hey everyone in Ontario!&nbsp; Well, at least, hello to you 50+ rock star developers from the CTT .NUG who signed up to participate in the Asp.Net MVC session this week! [![image](http://jameschambers.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image.png "image")](http://cttdnug.org)You guys rock!

I'm stoked to be running this Dojo out here – the attendance at the intro to MVC a few months back was really strong, so I’m honored to be invited back to dive deeper and get you guys writing code. We are going to build out a database-backed, membership-enabled, fully functioning web app.

This is a hands on session – I need you to bring your laptop along, and I highly recommend that you have the tools installed before you come. We have about 120 minutes – which is already tight – and if you spend the first 45+ minutes installing tools, you just won't get as much out of it!

Grab a copy of the following so you don't have to miss any sessions and you can dive right in:

**Visual Studio 2012** – This has everything you need. You can either grab a [free 90 day trial edition](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads) or a completely free [Express Web edition](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads).

**Visual Studio 2010** – But, you'll need to add some "fresh" if you want to hang out with the cool kids. Make sure you have the following:

*   [Visual Studio 2010 SP1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691)  <li>The latest version of [NuGet](http://nuget.org)  <li>[Asp.Net MVC 4](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4) _RTM Version _**IMPORTANT – **the project templates and tooling have changed. To get the most out of this dojo, I need you to have the final version of MVC4 running on your machine.

 > Just a quick note...while I am a totally huge Windows 8 fan and encourage you to try it out, for the purpose of this Dojo session I highly recommend running from Windows 7 (or boot to a VHD from Win8 to Windows 7). I will be demoing a tool that has not yet been updated to work with the new version of PowerShell on Windows 8.&nbsp; If you are already running Windows 8 full time (like me!) then I will be able to help you out and we can work around it. 

Really looking forward to meeting everyone and working through as much code as possible in about 2 hours. See you there!
