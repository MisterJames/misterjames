I woke up this morning – the first day of 2012 – and knew it was going to be a great year. The kids were playing together, actually getting along!, my beautiful wife had made me a fresh cup of joe, and after getting a good couple weeks of visiting in with friends and family over Christmas, I officially start my holidays tomorrow.

And then I checked my email.

I am very pleased to be recognized as an MVP by Microsoft in the area of ASP.NET.&nbsp; 

After completing my registration on the MVP site, I had a look around the list of community leaders already in the program for ASP.NET and realized I have a long way to go to consider myself peers with those folks.&nbsp; I read a lot of their blogs and many of the folks on the list have – through their articles, conference sessions, blog posts and emails – helped me out of more than one pickle.

Thanks to my nominator as well as the MVP lead here in Canada, and to Microsoft for this award.&nbsp; I look forward to another great year of working in the ASP.NET space!
