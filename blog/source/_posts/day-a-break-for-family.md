This past week I attended the funeral of my Grandma and, as such, put this series on hold. I am back from Northern Saskatchewan and I’ll be resuming the daily posts starting tomorrow.

In turn, we’ll be wrapping up this adventure on July 4, so we’ll go out with a bang.

A little later in the series we’re going to be working with a real-time pub/sub library called SignalR. It would be a good thing to do to read up on it a little, and perhaps even run through some of the exercises. I won’t be heavily covering it as it’s not the focus of this work, but we will use it to bring some interesting functionality into play.

While I’ve enjoyed the break and the chance to spend some time with family, I’m eager to wrap up the posts and finish off this work. 

Happy weekend.
