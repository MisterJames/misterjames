I just had the privilege and pleasure of speaking at the HTML5 Boot Camp Extravaganza in Winnipeg at the Delta Hotel.&nbsp; The event was hosted and organized by Microsoft Partner of the Year [Imaginet](http://www.imaginets.com) and sponsored by Microsoft.&nbsp; There were prizes for all attendees as well as breakfast, lunch and snacks…not to mention great conversation!

There’s a ton out there, but if you’re looking for something in particular don’t hesitate to ask.&nbsp; 

Thanks, Winnipeg, for participating in this event.&nbsp; We had 50 folks of all levels of experience in the room, which made for some great questions.&nbsp; I really enjoyed the format – tandem presentations with lots of dialogue – and hope that you guys did too.

See you at the SIG meetings in the ‘Peg over the next few months!
