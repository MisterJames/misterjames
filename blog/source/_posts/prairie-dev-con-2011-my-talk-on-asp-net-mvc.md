You know a conference is going well when you the connections start happening faster than you can manage to keep up with them.&nbsp; There were a lot of great people at the session today and a lot of great conversation afterwards.

Thanks to all who attended!&nbsp; I'll be doing another session tomorrow on NuGet and will post back here with all the critical links.

If you're looking to get started, make sure you check out this post I did with a ton of material for [ASP.NET MVC](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/blog/best-links-to-getting-started-in-asp.net-mvc3).

Also, for those of you who were excited about the MvcScaffolding bits, be sure to check out my [Joyride](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/blog/mvcscaffolding-joy-ride-with-ef-code-first) post on the same.

See you tomorrow!
