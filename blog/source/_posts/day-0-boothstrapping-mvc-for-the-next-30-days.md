In the coming weeks you’ll see a wide range of topics, tips, tricks and the ins-and-outs of working with the Bootstrap library and CSS framework with Asp.Net’s MVC Framework.&nbsp; This page will serve as the curated index of all posts for the month.

These posts will focus on using three key bits that are pre-requisites for the month: Visual Studio 2013, MVC 5 and Bootstrap.&nbsp; Along the way we’re going to make use of jQuery and even have a look at leveraging Knockout.js to make the client development a little less mundane.

Expect to start simple but be ready for a daily dose of content, presumably with something new for you each day, or at least a new twist on something you might be familiar with. Bring your&nbsp; willingness to try a bit of code, and I’ll try to bring some awesome.

**Shameless plug**: If you’re looking for professionally designed themes to replace your palette, you can help out this blogger (me!) by purchasing one over at [{wrap}bootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/?ref=BootstrapOnMvc). They have a selection of great looking Bootstrap themes. A very affordable alternative to taking the time to create your own theme. Check out [Day 23](http://jameschambers.com/2014/06/day-23-choosing-your-own-look-and-feel/) for more information on creating a site where users can choose which theme they see.

I’m assuming you’re a dev with some web experience. I’ll try to include some helpful links where content might be new or if questions come up. Thanks for joining along!
