In an effort to support some other ongoing initiatives I have migrated away from Orchard and onto WordPress.&nbsp; For now, I have been able to move over all my old posts, however in spite of how much I have valued them, comments were not able to make the move.&nbsp; 

There also may be some problems with images for the next few days as I make the move, but I will get those restored ASAP.

To all you wonderful folks who have contributed to my blog over the last two years while I was on Orchard, _thank you_. Your comments, suggestions and questions are very much valued and Iâ€™m sorry that they were unable to make the cutover.
