It's great to be speaking in my stomping grounds and to be able to share a little about the ASP.NET MVC Framework while I'm here at Prairie Dev Con 2011 Winnipeg.&nbsp; 

# Surviving the Boom!

Yikes. Talk about a presenter's nightmare! In the [perfect storm of technology fail](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=reviews/dell-xp-mini-displayport-projector-fix), my particular combination of laptop make and model, the Apple mini-displayport adapter and a wonky projector worked together to try to stop the presentation from happening at all.

Thanks especially to D'Arcy Lussier for making a last minute schedule change and squeezing me back in.&nbsp; There were about 50 people on board for the session with great questions and lots of interest.&nbsp; Please keep the feedback coming and stay tuned for lots more info on MVC 4 here in my scratching grounds.

As for diving deeper, join me tomorrow for a two-hour Dojo-style dive into MVC3 and we'll get your feet wet.&nbsp; Bring your laptops!

Here's a couple of links for you to help transition from what we talked about today in session to your own projects in your IDE:

Thanks again everyone for joining me and I look forward to seeing you at the Dojo session tomorrow.
