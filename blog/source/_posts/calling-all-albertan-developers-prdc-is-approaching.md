[![image](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/f339fdef32cd_8CDC/image_3.png "image")](http://www.prairiedevcon.com)I am excited to see the stars aligning for another round of Prairie Dev Con.&nbsp; This will be my third time speaking at PrDC and my first time in Calgary, where I worked for the better part of six years.&nbsp; I’m looking forward to getting back there…I can hear the mountains calling!

There’s a great mix of sessions covering a variety of topics.&nbsp; Some heavyweights from Microsoft are going to be there, delivering over 30 sessions on MS technologies.&nbsp; There’s also a ton of great speakers covering agile, data, patterns and newer trends such as NoSQL.&nbsp; Calgary local [Simon Timms](https://twitter.com/#!/stimms) will even run you through what it takes to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">hack</span> leverage phone systems in interesting ways.&nbsp; Interested in Windows Phone development?&nbsp; The one-and-only [Bil Simser](https://twitter.com/#!/bsimser) will be on hand to walk you through from project start to phone deployment.

Myself, I’ll be covering application development on the ASP.NET MVC framework.&nbsp; I’m doing an intro session that is a 65 minute wild ride through a project, as well as a Dojo-style 2 hour marathon for which you’ll need to prove yourself as a developer by writing code.&nbsp; **Bring your laptop**!

Registration is still open…head over to [http://www.prairiedevcon.com](http://www.prairiedevcon.com) for more information!
