That’s it. An email address. That’s all you need to get started.

Of course, this isn’t an offering limited to students, so for you seasoned vets, give up on that treadmill and commit to four weeks of levelling up.

Okay peeps, [go rock some awesome](http://bit.ly/learnGameDev)!

**_Shameless plug_**: if you’re wanting to ramp up your web-dev skills and get in on a 30 day challenge, be sure to [check out my book](http://jameschambers.com/2014/08/30-days-of-bootstrap-and-asp-net-mvc-5/) on Bootstrap and the MVC Framework with tons of tips on CSS, JS, jQuery, and ASP.NET’s MVC 5\. Each chapter is in digestible snippets that you can rock out in usually 15 minutes or less.
