[![image](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/The-Future-of-the-Web-on-.NET-Rocks_12433/image_thumb.png "image")](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/The-Future-of-the-Web-on-.NET-Rocks_12433/image_2.png)I recently spoke at Prairie Dev Con West in Calgary, where I was pleased to be asked to join a panel on the very popular internet audio talk show developers know as [.NET Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/)!&nbsp; Hosts Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell put together a panel to revisit a conversation they have every couple of years on "The Future of the Web".

The audio is now online, so [have a hear](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=752)!

Joined by my friend [Bil Simser](http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/), fellow Canadian [Andrew Nurse](http://vibrantcode.com/) from the Asp.Net team at Microsoft and [James Kovacs](http://jameskovacs.com/) of JetBrains, it was a great group with diverse experience that allowed us to dive into all kinds of topics.&nbsp; Starting with defining the current state of the web, we talked about current challenges, what the internet has become, and what the next few years holds for us as developers.
