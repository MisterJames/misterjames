I want to extend a huge thank you for all who attended my inaugural Asp.Net MVC3 Dojo event.&nbsp; Over a dozen folks came out and slogged away at code as we worked through building a movie review site end-to-end using the MVC Framework, NuGet and one mighty fine IDE, Visual Studio 2010.

Some of the things we covered in today's two and a half hour code work-out:

*   Models, views and controllers (of course!)  <li>Scaffolding and the MvcScaffolding package  <li>jQuery and AJAX in MVC  <li>Partial views  <li>Action filters  <li>Authentication and Authorization  <li>The MVC tool chain  <li>NuGet and little "gems" like jQuery.RateIt and MvcMembership.Mvc  <li>Customizing the output of the scaffolders  <li>EF Code First, data contexts and dbsets  <li>Data annotations  <li>Model binding  <li>JSON and other alternate action return types  <li>...and more 

&nbsp;

We covered a lot of ground, for sure.&nbsp; If you want to have at the reference app with the rest of the code that we weren't quite able to get to, please pop on over to [github](https://github.com/MisterJames/MovieFu) and grab a copy of the solution.

Looking forward to hearing the feedback and please, feel free to get in touch.

# Next Steps

Now that you've gone through File â€“&gt; New Project, don't stop there.

*   Make sure you get your IDE up to date  <li>Keep exploring MVC, including MVC 4  <li>Ask questions...
        *   On the [Canadian Developer Connection](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Canadian-Developer-Connection-3398140) (Linked In)...I keep watch here for web dev questions and am always happy to help out  <li>Here, on my blog ![Winking smile](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/Media/Default/Windows-Live-Writer/Ninjas-Unleashed-to-the-Wild_1378A/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png)  <li>Ask on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/canadianjames) with the #aspnetmvc hash tag  <li>Or on a community site you're already comfortable with <li>Have a good browse over at [nuget.org](http://nuget.org/) and find packages that will simplify your development

Thanks again!
