So, [last time](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/blog/bootstrap-asp.net-mvc-quickhits-installing-bootstrap) I walked you through how easy it was to get Twitter.Bootstrap into your Asp.Net Mvc project in Visual Studio 2010\. In this post, I walk you through what it takes to get the _Layout.cshtml updated so that your web site starts spanking like Spanish mule.&nbsp; I have no idea what that means.

Be sure to pop out the player or view it on YouTube as I put the post up in HD so that the code was easy to see. You’ll want to do that to follow along.&nbsp; This is a bit of a longer post, but I walk you through a fair bit of content.

And hey, stay tuned…in the coming days I’m going to cover a ton of stuff.&nbsp; Check out the [intro post](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/blog/bootstrap-asp.net-mvc-quickhits-installing-bootstrap) to see the list of videos I’m working on.

See ya soon!
