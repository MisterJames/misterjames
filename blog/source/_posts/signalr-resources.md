I’ve had the pleasure over the last few weeks of carrying on the discussion around real time web with folks in Calgary, Kitchener/Waterloo and most recently Saskatoon. It’s clear, from the questions that are coming up, that there is a real desire to help improve the user experience in mobile _and_ business apps – it’s not just about web.

I’ve put together some of the resources that I presented as well as the code that I wrote during the sessions. Here they are:

*   The source for SignalR basics – [http://asp.net/signalr](http://asp.net/signalr)
*   Follow the SignalR tribe on the Twitter – [@SignalR](https://twitter.com/SignalR)
*   Done your homework and still needing help? – [http://jabbr.net](http://jabbr.net) (join the SignalR room) 

A big thanks to the user groups and to [Prairie Dev Con](http://prairiedevcon.com/) for having me out, and thanks to everyone who joined in the conversation!
