For some folks, working independently and plowing through a book chapter-by-chapter is the best way for them to learn. If you're in that camp, I've got just the book for you.

## Want to get Hands-On?

For others, in-person training is the most effective way to dive into new content. Having someone in the same room who knows how to navigate a new release of software, framework and tooling and all the related changes is a powerful asset while you learn.

That said, we are pleased to announce our first Monsters workshop in Calgary, Alberta. Please join us in Calgary as we mash on changes, approaches, caveats and wins for all things in ASP.NET Core.

## We're Going To Learn a Lot Together!

My good friends [Dave](https://twitter.com/dave_paquette), [Simon](https://twitter.com/stimms) and I have been mashing on ASP.NET Core since its inception. This workshop is the culmination of what we have learned along the way and applied in our projects, samples and through our videos on Microsoft's Channel 9. We're taking you deep into three fully-packed days that walk you through various stages of application development. Our number one priority is to equip you with the skills you need to start on a Core MVC project and transition your existing skills to the new tooling.

We expect you to be familiar with web technologies and to be comfortable in Visual Studio. Beyond that, here is some of what you can expect:

- A solid foundation of ASP.NET Core with which you can build MVC applications
- Exposure to configuration, testing and extensibility
- Tips, samples and exercises that will guide you as you build software in the cloud
- An understanding of data access using the latest version of Entity Framework
- Access to the labs and source code used in the workshop

Be sure to check out our training site to [view the full curriculum](https://training.aspnetmonsters.com).

## Location, Location, Location

Calgary and area is home to some of the most beautiful sights in Canada, with a mountain range full of winter sports about an hour away, skiing at Calgary's Olympic Park as well as NHL and WHL Hockey on the edge of downtown. There are great restaurants, museums, art exhibits and theatre, along with with a great night life including brew pubs, world-famous Canadian poutine and an assortment of comedy clubs.

If you're joining us from outside the area, we highly recommend adding on a few days to your trip so that you can explore the area. If you are from outside of Canada, <b>you will need to get a valid International Driver's Permit</b> from your country before you leave if you wish to rent a car when you're here (handy for exploring!).

<b>Can't join us in Calgary?</b> No problem. Just hit the registration page and sign up for our email list to be notified of other upcoming training cities.

Happy New Year, and happy coding!
