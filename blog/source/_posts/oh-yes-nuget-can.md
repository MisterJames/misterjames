### Update Via Twitter

I received a message from one of the awesome NuGet folks on Twitter about [this post](http://oldblog.jameschambers.com/blog/real-world-scenarios-working-with-nuget) on NuGet real world scenarios:

David is pointing out that if you want to upgrade a package you can first remove its dependencies, which allows you to do so without NuGet unwinding the operation. Thanks to David for this! 

I responded by saying I’d still like a –ForceUpdate command that would bring all dependencies to the correct version (known as leveling) and have since discovered that such a feature is in the works for NuGet.&nbsp; 

More good things to come for sure.
